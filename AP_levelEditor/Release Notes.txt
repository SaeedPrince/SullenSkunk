** Obs **

The game is using jquery, css3, html5 and php as requested
All functions to manipulate DOM elements are done by javascript functions using jquery
The php server is acting as service provider to generate json, save and load

We tried to implement physics using the box2dweb but we couldn't understand how to iterate with all elements in the DOM
and generate them into the canvas
